Simple Social Share
===

**NOTE: This is work in progress and hasn't yet been tested** 

This is a really simple and lightweight plugin to add Facebook, Twitter and Google+ sharing to WordPress using official share buttons &amp; counts.

**Usage**
===

By default, the social shares will be added to the end of single posts via the is_single() check.

The shortcode <code>[social_share]</code> has been created to allow the social shares to be displayed on pages or in widgets wherever desired. Options to choose which networks to include will be added soon.
